## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

Iâ€™m Joshua Pickard, a PhD student at the University of Michigan, studying bioinformatics & digital biology for cellular reprogramming. I believe how we discover is as important as what we discover. Current projects include:

- **LLM Powered Digital Biology:** AI is changing not only what we know about science but also how we do science. Automating digital workflows (information retrieval, document search, etc.) will accelerate how we work and is a focuse of my retrieval augmented chatbot [BRAD](https://github.com/Jpickard1/BRAD)
- **Biomarker Observability:** recent experimental advancements will make data processing rather than acquisition the bottleneck in biological data science. Guided by observability, I am working on methods to identify new biomarkers in genomic signals.
- **Higher Order Networks:** Biological data comes in unconventional formats and necessitates new representations and analysis algorithms. I build the [Hypergraph Analysis Toolbox](https://hypergraph-analysis-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and develope new methods to analyze group interactions in the genome and beyond.
